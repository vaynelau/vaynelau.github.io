## About Me


I am a master student (2021.9 - present) in [School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://scse.buaa.edu.cn/) at [Beihang University](https://buaa.edu.cn/) under the supervision of [Prof. Xianglong Liu](https://xlliu-beihang.github.io/). I obtained my BSc degree in [School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://scse.buaa.edu.cn/) from [Beihang University](https://buaa.edu.cn/).

My research lies at the intersection of **computer vision** and **machine learning** â€“ with a special focus on building intelligent visual systems that are continual and data-efficient. My research interests include **few-shot learning**, **spatio-temporal predictive learning**, and **video prediction**.
